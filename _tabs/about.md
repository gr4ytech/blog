I'm a young, driven professional looking to make an impact wherever I land. 

I started this blog to help share my knowledge and experiences building projects that may help others along in the future. I'm passionate about Cloud, Cyber, and Network Security in general. I hope you find some use out of my insights!

If you want to get in touch about any opportunities, please send me an email or connect with me on LinkedIn!
